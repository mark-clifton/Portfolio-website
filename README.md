## Features

- Middleman static site framework.
- Layout customization using Middleman frontmatter variables.
- Separate Gulp tasks called both during and after build, using Middlemanâ€™s `external_pipeline` feature and `after_build` callback.
- CSS manipulation of inline SVG.
- Asynchronous loading of Typekit fonts reduces page render time (at the expense of a brief FOUC on some browsers).
- OpenType alternate character styles create typographical variety from a small number of web fonts.
- Aggressive image optimization, lazy loading, and inlining of dependencies yield Google PageSpeed scores in the 90s for all pages, even portfolio pages with several MB of image assets.

Note: Not all pages pass [W3C HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/) due to the markup required by the [Lazy Load](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload) script. However, there are fallbacks to maintain image accessibility despite the lack of validation.
